# Design Idea: overlapping transparency

So this idea needs to become more conrete, which it will in development. The idea is to place unto the 'canvas', that is the viewport, a bunch of transparent images that utilizes blurring effect from css-filters to blur individual images. Each image would consist of a png file, each png file would contain a single mark, a mark that nods towards marks that appear with the memphis design aesthetic. The emphasis of depth will be created through deploying css-shadows but with transparent content, so the effect of the gradient will appear. 

the blurring of these elements will be sequenced, randomly, on a queue when one animation ends, other start. each element will has event-handler for animationEnd, and when the animation for that element ends, the next set will be invoked. 

Using the margin-space as space for other navigation, the main-page will contain a link to the about you section.
