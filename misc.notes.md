2. [Body Anxiety](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/jan/26/body-anxiety/) A lot of artists, curated in some way, dunno what is that way

4. [White-wall capitalism](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/jan/6/the-blank-canvas/)

A lot of this stuff needs a closer inspection to draw out the boundaries of their concepts, and to basically examine what sort of gestures they are using in bringing/connecting these thangs 2gether
